-Hello! Iâ€™m Anthony Himmmelberger. Thanks for checking out my Github. A bit about me:

-I received my Master's from Clark University's GIScience program and was most recently working in Mammoth, Wyoming as 
the GIS Lead for the Geology Program at Yellowstone National Park. In this position I focused on maintaining and updating 
our GIS database using AGOL, ArcPro, and ArcGIS Collector. Additionally, I did field work varying from Thermal Area Preservation 
(TAPP), data logger maintenance, and backcountry surveying of all of the hydrothermal features in the park. 

-Outside of work, I have a passion for the cryosphere and have experience with remotely sensed products, large databases, and field work.
My past research and work has focused on remaking a GIS recreation department in Alaska, using Landsat imagery to track pond aquaculture 
conversion in Southeast Asia, revitalizing the Hadwen Arboretum at Clark University, classifying solar fields using machine learning, and 
analyzing satellite imagery of sea ice in Pacific walrus habitat.

-Feel free to take a look at some of the scripts I've worked on in the past! Although they're not beautiful, they get the job done! I'm by 
no means an expert coder, so I am always trying to improve my coding and write neater, cleaner code. 

-Tired of code? I invite you to take a look at my portfolio for some of my geospatial analyses with nice, visual results! It can be found at:
