-Hello!, I’m Anthony Himmmelberger
-I received my Master's from Clark University's GIScience program and was most recently working in Mammoth, Wyoming as 
the GIS Lead for the Geology Program at Yellowstone National Park. In this position I focused on maintaining and updating 
our GIS database using AGOL, ArcPro, and ArcGIS Collector. Additionally, I did field work varying from Thermal Area Preservation 
(TAPP), data logger maintenance, and backcountry surveying of all of the hydrothermal features in the park. 

-Outside of work, I have a passion for the cryosphere and have experience with remotely sensed products, large databases, and field work.
My past research and work has focused on remaking a GIS recreation department in Alaska, using Landsat imagery to track pond aquaculture 
conversion in Southeast Asia, revitalizing the Hadwen Arboretum at Clark University, classifying solar fields using machine learning, and 
analyzing satellite imagery of sea ice in Pacific walrus habitat.

-Feel free to take a look at some of the scripts I've worked on in the past! If you'd like to take a look at my portfolio, it can be found at:
